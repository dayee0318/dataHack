## Dependencies üì¶
The code for this project is written in Python and requires the following dependencies:

- pandas
- nltk
- textblob
- matplotlib
- wordcloud

To install the dependencies, run the following commands:
```commandline
pip install pandas
pip install nltk
pip install textblob
pip install matplotlib
```

## Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

The implementation consists of the following steps:

1. Load the data into a pandas dataframe.
2. Preprocess the text by removing stopwords and punctuation.
3. Perform sentiment analysis on the text.
4. Conduct named entity recognition on the text.
5. Generate a word cloud of the text.

Please refer to the code below for the full implementation.

## Results üìä
The results of this project include data visualizations that can be used to understand the findings of the dataset. The project includes word clouds generated from the preprocessed text, which show the most frequent words in the text.
